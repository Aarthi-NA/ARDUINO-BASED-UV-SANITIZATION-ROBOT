# ARDUINO-BASED-UV-SANITIZATION-ROBOT

This project is a mini project developed by Aarthi NA, Mirthula R, Sihabudheen S, and Sruti P as part of our Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Karpagam College of Engineering. The project was guided by Mr. G. Rajarathinam.

## Project Description

The Arduino Based UV Sanitization Robot is designed to sanitize surfaces using ultraviolet (UV) light. The robot is equipped with an Arduino board, UV light source, and motor to move around and sanitize surfaces. The project report includes a detailed description of the project, block diagram, working principle, future scope, and results. If you need ping me I'll share the document.

## Features

- Utilizes UV-C light for sanitization and disinfection.
- Automation of the sanitization process using a robot.
- Designed and developed using the Arduino IDE software.
- Incorporates UV LED lights and IR sensors for movement detection.
- Aims to reduce human exposure to viruses and bacteria.
- Cost-effective compared to other available technologies.

## Future Scope

- Implementation in various settings such as hospitals, schools, offices, and public transportation
- Integration of advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence for more sophisticated and efficient UV sanitization robots
- Potential applications in commercial spaces, restaurants, and public facilities for contactless disinfection

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need an Arduino board, UV light source, Uv sensor, IR sensor, Servo Motor and DC motor.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) installed on your computer. The IDE can be downloaded from the official Arduino website.
